<h1>Long read brain transcriptome dataset</h1>
<br>
Our study leverages both whole and targeted long read transcriptome sequencing data in 47 human cortex samples which span from prenatal to postnatal ages (6 wpc to 95 years). Please refer to Bamford et al. (2024) for more details.
Of note, current resource only generates annotations and plots for known genes.
